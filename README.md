## Connectivity

In a system like human brain, the similarity between recorded signals (electromagnetic, chemical, etc...) can give us a good information about functions of brain and later investigations about related diseases. The similarity criterion and variable normalizations finally form a weight matrix that can be transformed into a weighted graph, and if criterion is causal, a directional graph.
